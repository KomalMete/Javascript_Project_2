#Music Player using basic HTML,CSS and Javascript
The project is a basic music player implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It includes a user interface with song information (title and artist), an album cover image, playback controls (play, pause, forward, backward), a navigation bar, and a progress bar to track the song's playback progress. 
The project uses the Font Awesome library for icon representation.
